        Driven by Curiosity, Empowered by MERN: Meet James Huff.
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        Hello! I'm James, a passionate self-taught junior web developer with a strong focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). 
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey into the world of web development started with a thirst for knowledge and an insatiable curiosity. 
        Through rigorous self-study and hands-on practice, I have honed my skills in building dynamic, responsive web applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        While my formal education includes some college coursework, my true learning has come from diving into real-world projects, collaborating with fellow developers, and continually pushing the boundaries of my capabilities. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I thrive in environments where creativity and problem-solving are at the forefront, and I'm eager to contribute to innovative teams and projects.
      </p>

      <p>Let's create something amazing together!</p>
